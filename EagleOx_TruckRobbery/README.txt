If you are using a inventory that has a items.lua file add the items like they are listed below:

	["torch"] = {
		label = "Blow Torch",
		weight = 100,
		stack = false,
		close = false,
	},

	['lockpick'] = {
		label = 'Lockpick',
		weight = 160,
	},

If you are using a basic ESX server that uses a SQL/Database manualy insert the items listed above.
